# key will be the panel_name, witch is the absolute file name
# holding an set of view ids
# if the set is empty the panel will be destroyed
panel_state = {}

# Here is a brief explanation. Imaine we have file, A, B, C, D
# And that file A, have some functions defined in C, which are used in A
# And that file B, have some functiond defined in C and D, which are used in B
#
# The panel_state for that case would look like this:
# {
#   "C" : ["A", "B"],
#   "D" : ["B"]
# }
#
# Under the hood, two output panels are created for files C, D
# We grab of all the indexed simbols from the output panels.
# And later in completions show those symbols.
#
# If file B is closed, the panels_state would look like this:
# {
#   "C": ["A"]
# }
#
# The "D" panel was destoryed because there were no files associated to it.
# Similary if we closed the file A,
# The "C" panel would be destored, because there we no more files associated with it.
